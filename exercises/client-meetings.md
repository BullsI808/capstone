# Preparing for Client Meetings

This is a guide to help students prepare for client meetings. Listed are potential client questions and how to handle them. 

### Question:
Walk me through your design process. What steps do you take? _How involved should your clients be_

### Respones:
This is an opportunity for the team to show you how they approached their work. You want to express evidence that the team thought hard about the problem theyâ€™re trying to solve, and why they came up with that solution. You also want to make sure that the client has opportunities to review the work and give feedback.

### Question:
What are the milestones for this project?

### Response:
Explain the steps to complete the project. Make note that things may change after initial development starts to manage your clients expectations. Be clear that you will communicate changes throughout the project.

## Question:
Can you add a feature to the proposed solution?

### Response:
Make sure you let your client know that this is a prototype and not a full working solution. Features can be discussed if the project continues through to implementation. Kindly decline and say at this time, we've scoped out the project to it's minimum vial product. At the end of the project should you chose to go through to implementation, we can discuss additional features and re-scope, establish timelines etc.

### Question:
I don't like the theme, can you change it?

### Response:
Designs have been finalized for this prototype phase of the project. Again, if the project goes through to implementation we can discuss changing design details.

### Question:
Does it do XXXX? Will it be able to handle XXXX?

### Response:
We can build out additional functionality in the next phase.

### Question:
Explain how this is different from other apps like this?

### Response:
Be honest in your answer, back up your idea with the research you did prior to starting the project. Explain that this is just a step in the direction to a bigger solution. Paint a bigger picture, here's the opportunity where you can expand on possible features(stretch goals) if you were to implement the project in "real life"

## Do's and Dont's

- Avoid using the word "um" a lot, use the word "well"
- Avoid using the word "like" a lot, use "such as"
- Avoid silence, if you're not clear about a question, ask for clarification 
- Be respectful, be yourself, have a real conversation don't over kill with the yes ma'am and no sir. Be confident.
- If there's a question you can't answer just say "I'm not too sure on that, but I can find out and get back to you"
- DO NOT say yes to something you're not sure you can do.
